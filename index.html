                <p>Responsive Redesign for the Center for Biological Diversity’s existing Website</p>
                <p>Duration: 4 Weeks</p>
                <p>Team: 3 UX/UI Designers</p>
                <p>Tools Used: Figma, Miro, Google Drive, Google Surveys, Zoom, Pencil & Paper, Trello, Slack</p>
                <p>With so many environmental health concerns threatening our planet, our group of UX/UI Designers set about redesigning the web and mobile versions of the Center for Biological Diversity’s website. Our redesign now helps users prioritize the concerns that are personally relevant to them, and has a direct opportunity to increase contributions to these causes as a result.</p>

                <p>Our team of 3 UX/UI Designers conducted research through zoom meeting interviews and a google form survey.  Through this research we discovered that volunteers/donators want to see their direct impact on causes and be able to measure them.  Moreover, people said they want a way to search for events/causes that are relevant to them personally, and be able to share volunteer experiences with others.</p>

                <p>Natural preservation and biological diversity are a priority for many people & organizations today, but there are challenges around contribution motivation & execution.</p>
                <p>Being able to measure their direct impact on a cause can increase the likelihood of donors & volunteers contributing to a cause. Although this is a driving factor, the current website lacks this functionality in addition to the opportunity for users to see personally relevant information and the ability to share and learn from others within their network.</p>
                <p>How might we allow volunteers & donors to see their individual impact while connecting with those who hold similar beliefs, so that contribution motivation is increased and more effort is put forth to save nature and its ecosystems?</p>

            <p>Our usability testing participants were extremely helpful in iterating our first draft clickable prototypes for mobile and web.  We learned from users that the impact pages were still lacking a motivational aspect in terms of seeing their impacts, the site was dry & professional and that did not meet our company's mission and playful nature, and finally, the text size and button styles were limiting to the user so that needed to be addressed.  After selected modifications from the suggestions provided by stakeholders and test participants, we finalize our high-fidelity, responsive prototype.</p>

        <p>Through the process we sharpened our skills throughout the research-testing phases, and learned to collaborate as a team under a strict timeframe.  Collaborating in an organized Trello board and conducting stand-up meetings as a group was key to our pacing & success. Our team also learned what motivates animal-loving, environmental volunteers/donors, and how UX/UI strategies, when implemented properly, can have a positive impact on saving animal, plant, & natural life.  In the future, pur group would expand on the badges and other game strategies our redesign introduced to inspire even more donation and registration interaction.</p>
